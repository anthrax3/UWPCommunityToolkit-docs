# Bing Service

The **Bing Service** allows you to retrieve Bing results. Bing can return web results, news, images, and videos for many countries around the world in the language of your choice.

## Set up Bing API

**Note:**  The current version does not require the API key and is using the rate limited public access point.  The ability to specify your own key to remove the rate limits is on our backlog for a future release.

[Signup for API Access](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up) using your Microsoft account.  There is a free trial option for all of the Bing services (fully functional, just with API rate limits or capacity limits).

Choose the *Bing Search - Free* option.  After selecting this and agreeing to the terms of service you will be issued two keys that are limited to 5,000 queries per month.

## Example Syntax

{% highlight csharp %}

// using Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Services.Bing;

var searchConfig = new BingSearchConfig
{
    Country = BingCountry.UnitedStates,
    Language = BingLanguage.English,
    Query = SearchText.Text,
    QueryType = BingQueryType.Search
};

ListView.ItemsSource = await BingService.Instance.RequestAsync(searchConfig, 50);

{% endhighlight %}

**Note:**  Due to the limitations of Bing News, only 10 results are returned by the news service.
